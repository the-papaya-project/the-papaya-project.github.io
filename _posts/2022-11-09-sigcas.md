## Event Details
**Title:** Making CS education more equitable and accessible 
for our most marginalized students

**Date:** Wednesday, November 9, 1-2pm (ET)

**Abstract:** In this [SIGCAS](http://www.sigcas.org) (Special Interest Group for Computers and Society) WiP (Works in Progress) presentation, graduate students Victoria C. Chávez and Natalie Araujo Melo, and early career scholars Dr. Jennifer Tsan and Dr. Francisco Castro, will share collective hopes for the broader CSed / CER (computer science education / computing education research) community. This vision-in-progress is built on three pillars, currently titled: Valuation, Healing & Restoration, and Recognition. These pillars help acknowledge, respect, and dignify the collective and individual humanity for all scholars in the field, while centering Life for scholars of marginalized and minoritized identities. Presenters will share what the pillars mean for how faculty can better support their students, and how faculty can contribute to expanding and making this vision a reality.
